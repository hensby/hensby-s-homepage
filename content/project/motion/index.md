-Implemented Named Entity Recognition (NER) Algorithm development. Analysis of the police record data get crime name, address, and some other information. Using LSTM network to Determine entityâ€™s boundaries and CRF to get the Category of entity.

- Implemented Graph Storage and Clustering Algorithms development. To analyze, storage and cluster the entity after NER algorithm analysis. Implement Force Atlas, Spectral clustering and Visualization by Gephi. Using Python, and Neo4j database.
