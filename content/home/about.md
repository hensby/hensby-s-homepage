# Biography

Dr. Deokgun Park is an assistant professor of Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). His research focuses on open-ended tasks for text mining with two complementary approaches. In visual analytics (VA) approach, he studies how computational methods can scale up humanâ€™s ability to perform such tasks. And in artificial general intelligence (AGI) approach, he investigates the fundamental principle of neural information system such that a machine can acquire human language in a human-like way in a simulated environment.  He leads the Human Data Interaction Lab (UTA), which studies the way humans conduct exploratory data analysis, interactive tools for text mining, and testbed for artificial general intelligence (AGI).

His previous work on wearable healthcare and human computer interaction is available [here](https://intuinno.weebly.com/projects.html).
